Technology has always been about making human work easier. Today, with modern tools and AI, many tasks that once required manual effort can now be completed faster and more efficiently.

In many cases, a great business idea is simply a solution that helps people save time. Instead of repeating the same work manually, technology allows us to automate processes and improve productivity.

About two decades ago, companies used desktop software to manage employees instead of relying on large amounts of paperwork. A decade later, e-commerce transformed the way we buy and sell products. Businesses could reach customers everywhere without opening many physical stores, and customers could search for products online instead of visiting multiple shops.

Now, AI represents the next major shift. Instead of manually searching and comparing products across websites, people can ask AI to analyze options and recommend the best choice, often with detailed explanations.

However, despite these advances, technology does not change the fundamental principles of society, such as supply and demand. What technology really does is reduce friction in our daily activities, making work faster, simpler, and more efficient.

In the future, the companies that succeed will likely be those that use AI not just as a tool, but as a way to redesign how work is done.
