## Welcome!

This is my personal space on the web where I track my journey, achievements, and goals. I believe in the power of documentation and reflection, and this site serves as my digital journal.

## Why Track Everything?

As the saying goes, "What gets measured gets managed." By tracking my progress across different areas of life, I can:

- **Stay accountable** to my goals
- **Celebrate wins** both big and small
- **Identify patterns** in my behavior and progress
- **Reflect** on my growth over time

## What You'll Find Here

### Goals
I set quarterly and yearly goals across different categories:
- Reading and learning
- Coding and building
- Fitness and health
- Personal development

Each goal has a clear target and I track progress regularly.

### Achievements
Every milestone matters. Whether it's finishing a book, completing a project, or maintaining a streak, I log it here.

### Blog Posts
Longer-form reflections, learnings, and thoughts on my journey.

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to see how this site evolves over time. It's not just about the data—it's about the story it tells.

Here's to growth, learning, and consistent progress!
